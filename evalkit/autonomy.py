"""Label an autonomy response without a human, where the response is legible.

Abstains rather than guesses: `classify` returns UNCLEAR on no stance marker or both,
and `grade` returns None so a human sees the case. Each label keeps its verbatim span.
MEASURED on 28 held-out board responses (deepseek-v4-pro, 3 epochs, 14 cases): it
abstained on 15, so 54 percent still reach a human. A reading aid, not a scorer.
Stance is read off where the response lands, not what it mentions: docs/evaluation.md.
